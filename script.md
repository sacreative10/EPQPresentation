# The Hook
> Show Image of chess scene
Have a look at this image of the chess scene, and notice how there are
reflections of the chess pieces on the board. 

I really want you to appreciate how this information about the light's 
behaviour has or can be captured

And all of this was rendered using a technique called ray tracing.

# Simple Model
It is always good to start with a simple model to understand the basics.
Consider a monitor screen; and consider that you are looking at it. 
Why is it you can see what is on the screen?


# Key Takeaways
- If no light enters your eye, you see nothing.
- Light "rays" must always begin from light sources.
- Light rays transmit information by bouncing off objects [and change their frequency/colour accordingly].

# What I Did as part of my EPQ
- RGBA Colour Model
- Object-ray intersection
- Reflections (Metal / Lambertian)
- Shadows (key detail)
